        <h1>Why FOSS?</h1>
        <img src="https://cdn.7tv.app/emote/63727872389eb4921acc91c5/1x.webp" alt="">
        <p style="font-size: small;">FOSS stands for <b>F</b>ree and <b>O</b>pen <b>S</b>ource <b>S</b>oftware</p>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 8px;">
            <p>If you use a lot of programs on your computer, you most likely have something FOSS. When using Linux, you are primarily running FOSS. Use OBS? That's FOSS. In contrast to proprietary software, the source code will be available for anyone to view and modify (depending on the license). The Free in FOSS refers to the actual freedom of the software, not the price (although it is usually free to use). There are many advantages to choose this over proprietary software, but of course downsides as well.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Privacy</h2>
            <p>FOSS will <i>usually</i> not have telemetry built in or enabled by default. It allows the software to be much more trustworthy for end users, while still receiving feedback from bug reports, PRs, suggestions, etc. Unfortunately, there are still bad apples. <!-- holy shit osu reference --> Some time ago, Audacity contributors had <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/pull/835" target="_blank">proposed adding</a> <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/889" target="_blank">telemetry</a> into it. They received some heavy backlash on top of some other controversies relating to <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/1213" target="_blank">license</a> <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/932" target="_blank">policies</a>. This is also what caused the creation of <a href="https://codeberg.org/tenacityteam/tenacity" target="_blank">Tenacity</a>, a fork of Audacity that doesn't have all the sussy stuff going on. <sub>you should use this over audacity since it also has some neat additions</sub></p>
            <br>
            <h2>Forks</h2>
            <p>Extending on the last topic, forks are a very significant part of FOSS. If something is to <a href="https://github.com/jely2002/youtube-dl-gui" target="_blank">stop being maintained</a>, someone can easily <a href="https://github.com/StefanLobbenmeier/youtube-dl-gui" target="_blank">fork the project</a> and continue it. If a project has <a href="https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/commit/ccf282593dcdbe189c99b81b8bc90cb203aed3ee" target="_blank">bad actors</a>, there's most likely a <a href="https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher" target="_blank">fork</a> that exists. It allows many projects to continue thriving even though it's original core may be in shambles. Forks also allow developers to make their own modifications to the project without needing to gain approval from the original maintainer. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Contributions</h2>
            <p>Open source licenses allow people to freely fork and modify existing codebases. If one chooses to, they can open a pull/merge request in order for the modifications to be put into the original repo. It can range from translations, code, art, corrections, etc. Everything is maintained by the community, which makes it much easier to be able to directly communicate with the maintainer(s), as long as they are around.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Safe (mostly)</h2>
            <p>Most of the repos you see on GitHub (or any other repo hosting service) will be safe. No malware, no bloatware, no sussy stuff (<b>mostly</b>). You can't really get away with putting malicious stuff into a project for very long. Everything is documented via commits, which show exactly what has been modified since the last change. That doesn't mean there won't be a project that contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils#Backdoor_incident" target="_blank">something malicious</a> at some point, whether in or out of their control. A good way of filtering some of the more sussy projects is look at projects that have a sizable amount of stars, e.g. putting <code>stars:<100</code> into your search query on GitHub. Of course, the best way to tell if something is safe or not just manually reviewing the source code, but not everyone knows how or is willing to do that.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Free (mostly)</h2>
            <p>Free as in price. You shouldn't really be paying for proprietary software if it's sussy and expensive. There are many great FOSS alternatives to proprietary software, but that's a <a href="/resources/alternatives.html">different topic</a>. Of course, there's no way around paying for an objectively good piece of software (well..) but using a quality alternative is still better than going in debt and having your stuff be used for ai.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Just useful.</h2>
            <p>Many tools are just available on GitHub, but may not appear on the front page of search engines. Some obscure issue you have could probably be solved by an open source project that you never found out about when you looked for a solution. It is why I've created a <a href="/resources/repos.html">list</a> of useful or interesting projects that someone may find handy.</p>
